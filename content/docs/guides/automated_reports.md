Automated reports are a powerful feature of Briifd that allow you to receive regular updates on the topics and search terms you are tracking. By setting up automated reports, you can stay informed about the latest news and trends in your industry without having to manually search for information.

## Setting Up Automated Reports
Contact **support@briifd.com** to set up automated reports for your account. You can specify the frequency of the reports (daily, weekly, or monthly) and the topics or search terms you want to include in the reports. Once the reports are set up, you will receive them automatically at the specified intervals.
