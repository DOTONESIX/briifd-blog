Briifd is an AI-first media monitoring tool. We use ChatGPT as the interface for our AI media analyst. This guide will help you get started with Briifd and ChatGPT.

If you have not already, navigate to the [Briifd app in ChatGPT](https://chatgpt.com/g/g-3MfwSAsyt-media-monitoring-reporting-assistant-briifd). If you do not already have a ChatGPT account, you will need to create one for _free_. Once you have an account, begin chatting with Bruno, the Briifd AI media analyst to get started.

One of the first things Bruno will ask you to do is to 'Sign In'. If you do not already have an account, navigate to 'Sign Up' and create one. Once you have an account, you will be redirected back to the Briifd app in ChatGPT.
