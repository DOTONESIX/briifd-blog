A significant time-saving feature of Briifd is the ability to create reports on demand. This guide will show you how to run ad hoc reports in Briifd and customize them to suit your needs.

## Generating Reports
The ad hoc reporting feature in Briifd allows you to generate reports instantly based on your search criteria. You can filter articles by keywords, sentiment, location, impressions, date range, and more to create customized reports that meet your specific requirements.

Here's an example of how you can run an ad hoc report in Briifd:

- **Example:** `"Create a PDF report for all articles with the keyword 'AI' published in the last 2 weeks."`

Bruno will generate a report that includes all articles matching your search criteria. You can download the report to review the content, share it with your team, or use it for further analysis.

## Report Summary
The report has an optional summary section that provides an overview of the articles included in the report. The summary extracts the key points across all articles in the report, making it easier for you to understand the content at a glance.

## Customizing Reports
You can customize the report format and content to suit your preferences. Briifd offers full branding and customization options, allowing you to add your logo, change the color scheme, and include additional information in the report.
