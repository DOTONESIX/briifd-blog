Simply tell the assistant what company or topic you are interested in tracking, and it will suggest the best search terms to use.\nTracking a Topic Topics are the high level grouping of Search Terms. For example, if you are interested in tracking a topic such as \u0026ldquo;European Energy Policy\u0026rdquo;, you might have search terms such as \u0026ldquo;EU Energy Policy\u0026rdquo;, \u0026ldquo;European Energy Legislation\u0026rdquo;, \u0026ldquo;Renewable Energy in Europe\u0026rdquo;, etc. These search terms would all be grouped under the topic \u0026ldquo;European Energy Policy\u0026rdquo;. A topic can have multiple search terms associated with it, as well as \u0026ldquo;Relevance Criteria\u0026rdquo; for the AI to determine whether any articles are irrelevant.\nExample: \u0026quot;Track the topic 'European Energy Policy' in Brussels, Belgium.\u0026quot; The Language of the topic can also be set to ensure that the AI assistant reads articles in the correct language. This is particularly useful if you are tracking searches across multiple languages. Note that the AI assistant can read articles in multiple languages and translate the summaries into your preferred language.\nRelevance Criteria When setting up a topic, you will also need to set up Relevance Criteria. This is a natural language explanation of what you are tracking, why you are tracking it, and what you are looking for. The AI assistant will use this information to filter out irrelevant content when it reads articles. This is a key feature that helps differentiate Briifd from other media monitoring tools, as we use AI to understand the context of the content you are tracking rather than clutering your feed with irrelevant content.\nExample: \u0026quot;I am only interested in articles that discuss European Energy Policy in the context of renewable energy and climate change. I am not interested in articles that discuss energy policy in other regions or unrelated political articles.\u0026quot; Search Location You can also set up a Search Location for your topic. This is the region or country you are interested in tracking. For example, if you are tracking a topic related to \u0026ldquo;European Energy Policy\u0026rdquo;, you might want to set the search location to \u0026ldquo;Brussels, Belgium\u0026rdquo; to ensure you are getting relevant content. This can be used in combination with \u0026ldquo;Relevance Criteria\u0026rdquo; to ensure you are getting the most relevant content.\nTracking Search Terms Once you have set up a topic, you can start tracking search terms. These are the specific keywords or phrases you are interested in tracking. For example, if you are tracking the topic \u0026ldquo;European Energy Policy\u0026rdquo;, you might have search terms such as \u0026ldquo;EU Energy Policy\u0026rdquo;, \u0026ldquo;European Energy Legislation\u0026rdquo;, \u0026ldquo;Renewable Energy in Europe\u0026rdquo;, etc.\nWhen choosing search terms, consider the following:\nRelevance: Make sure the search terms are relevant to the topic you are tracking. Variety: Use a mix of search terms to capture different aspects of the topic. Specificity: Be specific with your search terms to get more accurate results. It is often best to set up the most broad search terms that will capture all relevant content, then have the AI filter irrelevant content based on your Relevance Criteria. The AI assistant will help you refine these search terms over time to ensure you are getting the most relevant results.\nLanguage is an important setting for search terms as well. This will affect the region that the AI assistant reads articles from. For example, the same search performed in German and English will return different results. If you need both, you can set up multiple search terms for each distinct language.\nSearch Terms also have Relevance Criteria and Search Location settings, similar to topics. You can set these up when you create the search term, or you can use the settings from the topic if you want to apply the same criteria to all search terms under that topic.\nExample: \u0026quot;Track the search term 'German Nuclear Energy' in Frankfurt, Germany under my 'European Energy Policy' topic.\u0026quot; Note: Articles may take up to 5 minutes to appear in your feed after you have set up a new topic or search term. This is because the AI assistant needs time to read and analyze the content before it can be displayed in your feed.\n","date":"2025-03-19","id":2,"permalink":"/docs/guides/track-your-first-topic/","summary":"\u003cp\u003eNow that your account is set up, we can start tracking topics and search terms using the AI assistant.
